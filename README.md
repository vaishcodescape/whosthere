Local Area Network discovery tool with a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) written in Go.
Discover, explore, and understand your LAN in an intuitive way.

Whosthere performs **unprivileged, concurrent scans** using [**mDNS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS)
and [**SSDP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol) scanners. Additionally, it sweeps the
local subnet by attempting TCP/UDP connections to trigger ARP resolution, then reads the
[**ARP cache**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) to identify devices on your Local Area Network.
This technique populates the ARP cache without requiring elevated privileges. All discovered devices are enhanced with
[**OUI**](https://standards-oui.ieee.org/) lookups to display manufacturers when available.

Whosthere provides a friendly, intuitive way to answer the question every network administrator asks: "Who's there on my network?"

## Features

- **Modern TUI:** Navigate and explore discovered devices intuitively.
- **Fast & Concurrent:** Leverages multiple discovery methods simultaneously.
- **No Elevated Privileges Required:** Runs entirely in user-space.
- **Device Enrichment:** Uses [**OUI**](https://standards-oui.ieee.org/) lookup to show device manufacturers.
- **Integrated Port Scanner:** Optional service discovery on found hosts (only scan devices with permission!).
- **Daemon Mode with HTTP API:** Run in the background and integrate with other tools.
- **Theming & Configuration:** Personalize the look and behavior via YAML configuration.

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WHOSTHERE_CONFIG` | Path to the configuration file, to be able to overwrite the default location.   |
| `WHOSTHERE_LOG`    | Set the log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Defaults to `info`. |
| `NO_COLOR`         | Disable ANSI colors in the TUI.                                                 |

## Configuration

Whosthere can be configured via a YAML configuration file.
By default, it looks for the configuration file in the following order:

- Path specified in the `WHOSTHERE_CONFIG` environment variable (if set)
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whosthere/config.yaml` (if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set)
- `~/.config/whosthere/config.yaml` (otherwise)

When not running in TUI mode, logs are also written to the console output.

Example of the default configuration file:

```yaml
# Uncomment the next line to configure a specific network interface - uses OS default if not set
# network_interface: eth0

# How often to run discovery scans
scan_interval: 20s

# Maximum duration for each scan
scan_duration: 10s

# Scanner configuration
scanners:
  mdns:
    enabled: true
  ssdp:
    enabled: true
  arp:
    enabled: true

sweeper:
  enabled: true
  interval: 5m

# Port scanner configuration
port_scanner:
  timeout: 5s
  # List of TCP ports to scan on discovered devices
  tcp: [21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 110, 135, 139, 143, 389, 443, 445, 993, 995, 1433, 1521, 3306, 3389, 5432, 5900, 8080, 8443, 9000, 9090, 9200, 9300, 10000, 27017]

# Splash screen configuration
splash:
  enabled: true
  delay: 1s

# Theme configuration
theme:
  # When disabled, the TUI will use the terminal it's default ANSI colors
  # Also see the NO_COLOR environment variable to completely disable ANSI colors
  enabled: true
  # See the complete list of available themes at https://github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere/tree/main/internal/ui/theme/theme.go
  # Set name to "custom" to use the custom colors below
  # For any color that is not configured it will take the default theme value as fallback
  name: default

  # Custom theme colors (uncomment and set name: custom to use)
  # primitive_background_color: "#000a1a"
  # contrast_background_color: "#001a33"
  # more_contrast_background_color: "#003366"
  # border_color: "#0088ff"
  # title_color: "#00ffff"
  # graphics_color: "#00ffaa"
  # primary_text_color: "#cceeff"
  # secondary_text_color: "#6699ff"
  # tertiary_text_color: "#ffaa00"
  # inverse_text_color: "#000a1a"
  # contrast_secondary_text_color: "#88ddff"
```

## Daemon mode HTTP API

When running Whosthere in daemon mode, it exposes an very simplistic HTTP API with the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                        |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/devices`     | Get list of all discovered devices |
| GET    | `/device/{ip}` | Get details of a specific device   |
| GET    | `/health`      | Health check                       |

## Themes

Theme can be configured via the configuration file, or at runtime via the `CTRL+t` key binding.
A complete list of available themes can be found [**here**](https://github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere/blob/main/internal/ui/theme/theme.go), feel free to open a PR to add your own theme!

Example of theme configuration:

```yaml
theme:
  enabled: true
  name: cyberpunk
```

When the `name` is set to `custom`, the other color options can be used to create your own custom theme.
When the `enabled` option is set to `false`, the TUI will use the terminal's default ANSI colors.
When `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, all ANSI colors will be disabled.

## Logging

Logs are written to the application's state directory:

- `$XDG_STATE_HOME/whosthere/app.log` (if `XDG_STATE_HOME` is set)
- `~/.local/state/whosthere/app.log` (fallback Linux/MacOS)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%/whosthere/app.log` (fallback Windows)

When not running in TUI mode, logs are also written to the console.

## Known Issues

For clipboard functionality to work, a [**fork of go-clipboard**](https://github.com/dece2183/go-clipboard) is used.
Ensure you have the appropriate copy tool installed for your OS:

| OS                                     | Supported copy tools                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Darwin                                 | `pbcopy`                                     |
| Windows                                | `clip.exe`                                   |
| Linux/FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Dragonfly | X11: `xsel`, `xclip` <br> Wayland: `wl-copy` |

## Disclaimer

Whosthere is intended for use on networks where you have permission to perform network discovery and scanning,
such as your own home network. Unauthorized scanning of networks may be illegal and unethical.
Always obtain proper authorization before using this tool on any network.
